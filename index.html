        <p class="AboutMe">
            My name is Midyan Elghazali. I’m currently a student at Hunter College, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. As someone who loves technology and innovation, I enjoy programming in Java, C++, Python, and HTML/CSS. I’ve always been passionate about machine learning, AI, and developing full-stack applications that make an impact, such as my note-sharing platform.
